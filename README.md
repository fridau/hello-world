# hello-world
A short description lol


Hi there. I'm learning to code because apparently I chose the wrong career.
That sucks, you know?
I like to blame my Alma Mater because although there were quite a few passionate teachers
most teachers were lazy middle aged engineers that didn't give a shit 
about the students learning
just were there for the money.
So, they would go to class, and do nothing and don't care about us cheating in papers
or exams.
Who can learn something that way?

But is also true that we were already adults and we could've teached ourselves.
And I will accept my fault. 

They say that the student's talent is the same,
no matter what school you're in. 
I was a lazy student that took everything for granted because basic education
was pretty easy for me. So I thought I was kind of a genius and that, eventually,
I was going to figure out everything.

Well, I didn't.

I wanted to learn everything from the teachers and didn't do any research myself.
Pretty stupid, huh?

Anyway. I'm here, being an unemployed bitch who doesn't like the 
typical work that's done by my fellow colleagues, but is trying to pursue 
to be succesful doing something I like.

Well, I like computers and programming.
This is my first try.
Wish me luck.
